# KOSPI viewer and predictor

Live demo at : https://kospi-stocks.herokuapp.com/

A live KOSPI Stock viewer from scraping and cleaning real time stock data. Includes a chart, company's financial information, and daily stock information for specific tickers from a dropdown menu, and uses regression models to predict stock prices for chosen stock.

The predictions from the regression models are not definite. Although the data was cleaned and processed, the main purpose of this project was to visualize a dashboard to represent data and charts. For a complete end-to-end machine learning project regarding the prediction of stock prices, check this repository: https://github.com/jihwankimqd/Stock_Analysis
